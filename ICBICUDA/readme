the code is a first version of ICBI in CUDA, using part of a nVidia demo to load bmp images
it should be optimized and modified in order to change parameters from  the command line
(now parameters are set into the code)  and to use a library for generic image handling

images are enlarged approximately by 2x at each call of the cuda_ICBI
the c example supports 2x and 4x enlargement selected with the macro FACT

alpha beta gamma of ICBI and number of iterations of the iterative steps are written in variables inside
the kernels icbiIter1 icbiIter2 created for the 2 steps.
the number of iterations of each iterative step is fixed in the constant iter in cuda_ICBI
(now set to 8, iterative correction is called twice with different value of the color modification, 
meaning that for each of the two steps 16 iterations of the energy based pixel correction are actually done).
behavior at borders should be fixed.
